#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - n is growing linearly in this snippet.
n is the make or break in this snippet. As n grows so so the runtime

b) O(n^2) - There are 2 loops in this snippet. Each loop is an O(n), they get multiplied together to get the O(n^2) runtime. n is being checked twice.

c) O(n) - For more specificity this would actually be O(n - 1), the reason for this is because it is a recursive function.
It is running linearly and subtracted by 1 each time the recursive call is made.
